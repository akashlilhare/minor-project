#  SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TEXT
This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter, that is classifying tweets according to the sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative or neutral. This project of analyzing sentiments of tweets comes under the domain of “Pattern Classification” and “Data Mining” and it would heavily rely on techniques of “Natural Language Processing” in extracting significant patterns and features from the large data set of tweets and on “Machine Learning” techniques for accurately classifying individual unlabeled data samples (tweets) according to whichever pattern model best describes them.

**Sentiment Analysis**  – One of the most popular projects in the industry. Every customer facing industry (retail, telecom, finance, etc.) is interested in identifying their customers’ sentiment, whether they think positive or negative about them.

Python sentiment analysis is a methodology for analyzing a piece of text to discover the sentiment hidden within it. It accomplishes this by combining machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis allows you to examine the feelings expressed in a piece of text.

### About Sentiment Analysis

In this machine learning project, we build a binary text classifier to classify the sentiment behind the text. We use the various NLP preprocessing techniques to clean the data and utilize the LSTM layers to build the text classifier.

### Python Sentiment Analysis Dataset

The dataset contains more than 14000 tweets data samples classified into 3 types: positive, negative, neutral
